# Machine-Learning

A web application for predicting the likelihood of having a heart attack that uses machine learning techniques including Logistic regression, Radial basis function SVM, Linear SVM, Polynomial SVM, Decision tree, Random forest, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes. Random Forest produced the results with the best accuracy of 88.52% out of these supervised machine learning algorithms. Jupyter Notebook environment has been used to execute the project and write the Python code. The web app deployment was done by the Heroku Server. In order to do that, programs have been submitted to GitHub, and then connected the model from GitHub to Heroku.
